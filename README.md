end_mill_box
============

A simple box to put my end mills into.

This is written in OpenSCAD and is fairly parametric.

You can see how many rows of end mills you want the box to hold, and
how many bits there are per row.

You can set the label text to be whatever you want (but it does not
checking to make sure that it will be completely inside your box's
lid.)

We used the font from: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:22730
for the label text.

You need to render and export the top, bottom, and dual-strusion label
text separately (I had problems running the 12 hour builds that would
print both top and bottom at the same time.)
